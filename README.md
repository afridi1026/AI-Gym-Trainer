# AI-Gym-Trainer

It is an AI based assistant to detect the bicep curls exercise form. It will not count any rep until it is done with the appropriate form.

As everybody's body allows different level of flexibility, I have added two variables "FlexedHandAngle", "StraightHandAngle". Get these values by running the AITrainer.py file once as it'll show the angle on elbow at each point.

Note down the angle values for both cases and replace with the already mentioned values.

Run it again then and it'll will work absolutely according to you.

PoseModule file contains the methods for detecting landmarks on hands, calculating angle etc.
